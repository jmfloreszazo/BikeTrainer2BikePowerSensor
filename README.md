# BikeTrainer2BikePowerSensor
This example gets the ANT+ signal of a "Fitness Equiptment- Controls ( FE- C )" and outputs the standard signal a "Power Meter"

For example I used the following hardware:

  - Qubo Digital Smart B+ -> /https://www.thisisant.com/directory/qubo-digital-smart-b/
  - Garmin Edge 520 -> https://www.thisisant.com/directory/edge-520/
  - Garmin Fenix 3 -> https://www.thisisant.com/directory/feenix-3/
  - USB ANT Stick
